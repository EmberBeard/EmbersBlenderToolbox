# Ember Beard's Blender Toolbox

This is a small addon for blender containing a bunch of custom utilities to make my avatar development process a little easier. Maybe you'll find this useful.

## Tools


| Tool  | Description |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Recapture as shapekeys | This will scrub an animation timeline for markers. At each marker, for the selected mesh in the scene, it will save the animation pose of the mesh from the armature as a shapekey. It will then name that shape key to match the marker. This is especially useful for when you want to generate blendshapes off the shape of a face rig |
